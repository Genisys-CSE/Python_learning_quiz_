Data Types:
• Data type is the classification of the 
type of values that can be assigned
to variables.
• Dynamically typed languages, the 
interpreter itself predicts the data type
of the Python Variable based on the 
type of value assigned to that variable

Data Types (Numbers):
The number data type is divided into 
the following five data types:
• Integer
• Long Integer (removed from py3)
• Floating-point Numbers
Complex Numbers

Strings
Data Types (String):
• Python string is an ordered 
collection of characters which is used 
to represent and store the text-based 
information
*Mutable Data Types: Data types in 
python where the value assigned to a
variable can be changed
*Immutable Data Types: Data types in 
python where the value assigned to a
variable cannot be changed

Data Types (Tuples):
• Tuple data type in Python is a 
collection of various immutable Python
objects separated by commas.
A Python tuple is created using 
parentheses around the elements in 
the tuple.

Data Types (List):
Unlike strings, lists can contain any sort 
of objects: numbers, strings and other 
python list
Enclosed between square brackets ‘[]’
Ordered collections of arbitrary objects

Data Types (Set):
• It is an unordered collection of 
elements which means that a set is a
collection that stores elements of 
different Python Data Types.
For example:
myset = {“bennett”, “computer”, “science”}

Data Types 
( Dictionary):
• The keys are separated from their 
respective values by a colon (:) 
between them, and each key–value pair is 
separated using commas (,).

Datatype Conversion:
• As a matter of fact, we can do 
various kinds of conversions between
strings, integers and floats using the 
built-in int , float , and str functions
For example:
>>> x = 10
>>> float(x)
